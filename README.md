## Introduction


## Dataset

We utilize the [J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Payment Data for Fraud Protection](https://www.jpmorganchase.com/about/technology/research/ai/synthetic-data), a synthetic dataset for privacy. This subject-centric data contains over 1.49 million transactions (electronic transfers, bill payments, deposits, withdrawals) spanning approximately 50 years. Each entry details the transaction amount in U.S. dollars, involved accounts (sender, beneficiary, or both), and other identifying features.

## Methods and Models

_Models and Tools Used:_ Logistic Regression, XGBoost, Linear Discrimination Analysis, PCA
